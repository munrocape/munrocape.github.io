## Jekyll helper scripts

This is a collection of helper scripts for common actions when managing a Jekyll blog.

### Creating a new post

`new_post` takes in 1 argument: the name of the file.

It will create a file in the `_posts` directory with the name `$y-$m-$d-$1.md` with a default header for the post.
