A number of classes post lecture recordings and other material on play.library.utoronto.ca. 

Unfortunately, there is no option to download the material or change the playback speed with the embedded player. Furthermore, it is being streamed to the desktop in chunks so you cannot easily download the resource.

However, you can play the resource through VLC and control the streaming with VLC's controls.

The following was done with Safari and VLC.

1. Open the `play.library` URL, right click the video, and copy the source URL.
2. Open VLC. Select "Open from network" and paste in the address.
3. Use the playback speed controls to speed up or down.

Voila.
